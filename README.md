## Introduction

## Prerequisites
* [Material Design in XAML Plugin](http://materialdesigninxaml.net/)
* [SQLite/SQL server compact v4.0 toolbox](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ErikEJ.SQLServerCompactSQLiteToolbox)
* [Microsoft SQL Server Compact v4.0](https://www.microsoft.com/fr-fr/download/details.aspx?id=17876)

## Setup
1- First you start by cloning the project in your hard drive <br />
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Ozoubia/HotelManagementSystem.git
    ```
   
2- Open the project in Visual studio IDE <br />
3- You will have to install the missing packages, Go to NuGet Package Manager in VS, It'll ask you to download the missing packages 
automatically which is the best option, wait for them to be installed and you're good to go.<br />
4- If the automatic package download fails you have to download each package manually, here are the packages:
   * MaterialDesignThemes
   * SQL server compact v4
   


**PS** : Sometimes installing the packages automatically will install **EntityFramework.SQlServerCompact** along with them (which in this case we don't need and it will cause an error, so if it is installed go to NuGet Package Manager and remove it from the project) 


## Built with 
- Visual studio 2017 IDE
- C# .NET 4.7
